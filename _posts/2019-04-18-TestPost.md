In “Differance”, Jacques Derrida  undertakes a critique of the Western philosophical tradition and its tendency to look for ways to an unmediated truth, or a truth that exists prior to signification, typically within language. A part of the way Derrida forms his critique is by questioning the distinctions made between speech and writing within this philosophical tradition. Specifically, he is addressing the primacy of speech over writing. Within the history of Western philosophy, speech is considered to come from the soul, and thus is associated with access to an unmediated truth. Because speech is understood as being free of signification, it holds a primacy over writing, which is understood as being immersed in signification.

Derrida critiques the notion that speech is free of signification and discusses how both speech and writing are engaged in the use of signs,
"When we cannot take hold of or show the thing, let us say the present, the being-present, when the present does not present itself, then we signify, we go through the detour of signs. We take up or give signs; we make signs. The signs would thus be a deferred presence. Whether it is a question of verbal or written signs . . . the movement of signs defers the moment of encountering the thing itself, the moment at which we could lay hold of it, consume or expend it, touch it, see it, have a present intuition of it."

Significantly, Derrida is able to frame both speech and writing within signification through the concept of deferral or delay. Within classical semiotics, signs are supposed to allow us a mediated access to truth, but also present us with a temporal delay from that truth. Within Derrida's argument thus far, whether we are reading written text or listening to speech, we are not instantly accessing a truth at the same time that this truth is being presented to us via the sign. This is because the time required to process the sign temporally displaces us from the truth being signified.

Derrida addresses the objection against his argument concerning the consciousness of the speaking subject. The objection states that truth and meaning can come from a living presence within a speaking subject, and that language can be manipulated by a subject to articulate their true selves. Derrida draws on Nietzsche and Freud here to question the authority of consciousness and the speaking subject. Again, Derrida finds utility in deferral and delay, ". . . differance in no way implies that the deferred presence can always be recovered, that it simply amounts to an investment that only temporarily and without loss delays the presentation of presence, that is, the perception of gain or the gain of perception."  Derrida is suggesting that we are not only temporally displaced from a truth via the sign, but also that there is a delimiting or loss of some truth that occurs when we take up signs. Derrida continues, "With the alterity of the 'unconscious,' we have to deal not with the horizons of modified presents - past or future - but with a 'past' that has never been or will ever be present, whose 'future' will never be produced or reproduced in the form of presence."  Derrida uses the temporal displacement of delay to question the "presence" or "being-present" of the living presence within the speaking subject. Derrida suggests that if the living presence within the subject is never really present in its use of language, then the project of prioritizing "living" speech over "non-living" or "dead" writing is undermined.

<!--Below is a brief reminder of the Markdown syntax, from [one of the GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

# Headers:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4


# Emphasis:

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*

# Block quotations

Below is a block quotation:
> Muchos años después, frente al pelotón de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo.

# Lists
## Unordered:
* Item 1
* Item 2
 * Item 2a
 * Item 2b

## Ordered:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
 * Item 3a

# Images:
![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png)
(The bit between the square brackets becomes the "Alt Text", or the text that appears when you hover over an image. Notice how the image source [the bit in square brackets] can reference a folder in your project or any image on the internet.)

# Links
[GitHub](http://github.com) <- You put the text of the link in the square brackets, and the URL in parentheses.


# Backslash escapes
If you would like to display a character that would otherwise be interpreted by Markdown to indicate formatting, you can prefase it with a backslash `\`, e.g. \*literal asterisks\*

# Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row),
and then separating each column with a pipe | :

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ---
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content cell 4 | Content cell 5 | Content cell 6

These are most of the formatting options built into Jekyll, but you might want to do more specialised things. For instance, you might want to insert a picture aligned to one side of the page. Or you might like to insert a map from Mapbox. For this you will need to use HTML. We will cover this in greater detail later on. For now, [here is an excellent guide to HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).

For now, here is a Mapbox map in a thing called an [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp):

<iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/juancobo/cjs11m0to0avh1fqj3r9nhjg8.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoianVhbmNvYm8iLCJhIjoibUZtUDNvVSJ9.LbmhhDxGc4BTb7G2JpKlZA#9.9/5.421206/-73.382440/0" width="100%" height ="300px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

And an image, for which I've specified parameters to determine how it should appear:

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png" style="display: block; width: 300px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" />

Another useful bit of HTML is `<br>` for a line break.

Notice how the above is in a code block outlined by a grave accent ( \` ). That tells Markdown not to interpret it, but to display it exactly as you've typed it. You can also enclose entire lines by placing three accent marks (\`\`\`) above and below the lines in question.

For instance, if I wanted the page to display the code for the iframe above rather than render it, I would do this:


`<iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/juancobo/cjs11m0to0avh1fqj3r9nhjg8.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoianVhbmNvYm8iLCJhIjoibUZtUDNvVSJ9.LbmhhDxGc4BTb7G2JpKlZA#9.9/5.421206/-73.382440/0" width="100%" height ="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>`

Or this:
```
<iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/juancobo/cjs11m0to0avh1fqj3r9nhjg8.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoianVhbmNvYm8iLCJhIjoibUZtUDNvVSJ9.LbmhhDxGc4BTb7G2JpKlZA#9.9/5.421206/-73.382440/0" width="100%" height ="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
