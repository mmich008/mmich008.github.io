<body>

<p>In the above photo, we see what appears to be a man, though the bottom half of his body appears to have not made it into the photo somehow. We can see the reflection of his entire body, and of the body taking the photo, in the glass door behind him. He is looking directly at the camera, his facial expression indicating that he was speaking when the shot was taken (though we might also "playfully" read his facial expression as objecting to the erasure of half of his body).</p>

<p>The above photo makes up a single shot in a 360-degree photo of a room filled with children's toys. The 360-degree photo was found on Google Maps street view of Gaza, in the Gaza Strip. Other 360-degree street view images of the Gaza Strip mostly focus on capturing a picturesque landscape, giving us beautiful 360 images of water, beaches, pools, and crops. At the time of this writing, there is only a single 360 image of a destroyed building, abandoned of all life. Within the 360 images of water or water-intensive objects, we might find a few broken pipes, a little bit of rubble, and maybe even a few "makeshift huts". Within the context of these images, these traces of damaged infrastructures don't seem to signal settler-colonial violence, but rather a kind of decontextualized poverty that might normally be assigned to "third world" spaces. Significantly, these images also don't tend to contain actual Palestinians as their subject. Palestinian bodies are secondary to the main focus of the image, which is the landscape. Palestinian bodies appear in the "side" or "background" of the images - an impressive feat, considering that 360-degree images are supposed to be "immersive" and "all encompassing". Palestinian bodies really only seem to function here for the purposes of "authenticating" the tourist-like photos. Israeli occupation and violence from the IDF simply don't appear in the Google Maps street view of the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The aim of this paper is to think through the ways in which Palestine is mediated, with specific focus on the street view function of Google Maps. Drawing on Jacques Derrida and Judith Butler, I interrogate and deprivilege the field of the visual. Not only do I refute the assessment of the visual as providing unmediated access to truth, but I also emphasize that the functionality of the visual is dependent upon the erasure and failure to capture the ruptures that would otherwise destabilize the visual as a regime of knowledge. I contextualize this interrogation of the visual within the violences imposed upon Palestinians to demonstrate that even within the visual economies that subordinate Palestinians to Israelis, Palestinians themselves must be excluded for such a visual dichotomization to function. I then draw upon Brian Massumi and Catherine Clement to think about affect as a way to interrupt these visual economies and to work towards "new ways of seeing" Palestinians and their affective connections to Palestinian land.</p>

Below is a brief reminder of the Markdown syntax, from [one of the GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

# Headers:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4


# Emphasis:

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*

# Block quotations

Below is a block quotation:
> Muchos años después, frente al pelotón de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo.

# Lists
## Unordered:
* Item 1
* Item 2
 * Item 2a
 * Item 2b

## Ordered:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
 * Item 3a
 * Item 3b

# Images:
![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png)
(The bit between the square brackets becomes the "Alt Text", or the text that appears when you hover over an image. Notice how the image source [the bit in square brackets] can reference a folder in your project or any image on the internet.)

# Links
[GitHub](http://github.com) <- You put the text of the link in the square brackets, and the URL in parentheses.


# Backslash escapes
If you would like to display a character that would otherwise be interpreted by Markdown to indicate formatting, you can prefase it with a backslash `\`, e.g. \*literal asterisks\*

# Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row),
and then separating each column with a pipe | :

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ---
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content cell 4 | Content cell 5 | Content cell 6

These are most of the formatting options built into Jekyll, but you might want to do more specialised things. For instance, you might want to insert a picture aligned to one side of the page. Or you might like to insert a map from Mapbox. For this you will need to use HTML. We will cover this in greater detail later on. For now, [here is an excellent guide to HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).

For now, here is a Mapbox map in a thing called an [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp):

<iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/juancobo/cjs11m0to0avh1fqj3r9nhjg8.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoianVhbmNvYm8iLCJhIjoibUZtUDNvVSJ9.LbmhhDxGc4BTb7G2JpKlZA#9.9/5.421206/-73.382440/0" width="100%" height ="300px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

And an image, for which I've specified parameters to determine how it should appear:

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png" style="display: block; width: 300px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" />

Another useful bit of HTML is `<br>` for a line break.

Notice how the above is in a code block outlined by a grave accent ( \` ). That tells Markdown not to interpret it, but to display it exactly as you've typed it. You can also enclose entire lines by placing three accent marks (\`\`\`) above and below the lines in question.

For instance, if I wanted the page to display the code for the iframe above rather than render it, I would do this:


`<iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/juancobo/cjs11m0to0avh1fqj3r9nhjg8.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoianVhbmNvYm8iLCJhIjoibUZtUDNvVSJ9.LbmhhDxGc4BTb7G2JpKlZA#9.9/5.421206/-73.382440/0" width="100%" height ="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>`

Or this:
```
<iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/juancobo/cjs11m0to0avh1fqj3r9nhjg8.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoianVhbmNvYm8iLCJhIjoibUZtUDNvVSJ9.LbmhhDxGc4BTb7G2JpKlZA#9.9/5.421206/-73.382440/0" width="100%" height ="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
