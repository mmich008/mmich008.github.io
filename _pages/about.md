<p>Mediating Palestine is a webspace created for the collection of media representations of Palestine. The word "mediating" in the title does not refer to the "problem-solving" sense of the word - this space is NOT about "solving" Palestine. Rather, "mediating" refers to the ways in which we understand what Palestine is through media. It is, however, important to establish that these different senses of "mediation" are not mutually exclusive in the case of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. After all, it is pretty common to see various media representations of Palestine and Palestinians within discussions of "solutions" to the conflict.</p>

<p>By gathering mediations of Palestine, this site attempts to provoke questions such as: What are we seeing when we look at Palestine? Why is there a strong recourse to mapping Palestine in the midst of the conflict? Who is mapping Palestine and how is Palestine being mapped? What does mapping offer in terms of mediating and mediating Palestine? What types of knowledge are being privileged in different mediations of Palestine? How do we de-privilege knowledge regimes around Palestine? How do these mediations complicate data and databases? What does this collection suggest about the data-based ways in which we attempt to "capture" Palestine?</p>

<p>And in case there was any doubt: THIS IS A PRO-PALESTINE SPACE. Go away if you're not down with the cause.</p>
